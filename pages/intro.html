            </p>
            <p> Hi! I'm Aditya Taparia, a first-year Computer Science PhD student at Arizona State University, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.ransalu.com/">Ransalu Senanayake</a> 
                and affiliated with the <a href="https://ransml.github.io/lens-lab/">Laboratory for Learning Evaluation and Naturalization of Systems (LENS Lab)</a>.
                
                My research is centered on the conceptual foundations of neural networks—exploring how models form, refine, and leverage
                high-level abstractions or “concepts” to learn effectively and make informed decisions. I aim to develop concept-driven AI systems
                that are more robust, adaptable, and capable of handling distribution shifts in evolving real-world environments. By grounding
                learning and decision-making in explicit concepts, I seek to improve model's interpretability, generalization, and optimize
                AI-driven decision processes.</p>

            <p>Previously, I completed my Bachelors with Honors in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Kottayam.</p>

            <p>I'm always happy to connect about research, collaborate on ideas, or share advice. Please feel free to get in touch!</p>
